## Hack 1
Gru has just recently stopped El Macho from destroying the world. But now, Gru needs to separate the leftover purple minions and the yellow minions so that he can cure the infected minions. He then needs to organize the minions in terms of recovery time and usefulness. To do this, Gru needs you to make a minion class with the instance variables ``color, name, energy levels, gadgets, hair, height``

## Hack 2
Now Gru needs you to make a default constructor for all the NPC minions. Assign each default minion a default color,name,energy level, gadget, hair, and height. 

## Hack 3
Now please make a parameterized constructor to create the main-character minions easily.

## Hack 4
Create three minions and print out their values(color, name, energy levels, gadgets, hair, height)

## Hack 5
Gru wants to make sure his workers are not overworked as per OSHA. So, Gru wants you to print out the average energy levels of all his Minions. (Hint: you should use static variables) 

## For 0.90+
Dr. Nefario is trying to assign a recovery time for each minion! Minions who were purple and got cured are very tired, and so are a lot of minions with low energy levels. Create a simple algorithm to calculate how long each minion needs to recover based on their color and energy levels.
