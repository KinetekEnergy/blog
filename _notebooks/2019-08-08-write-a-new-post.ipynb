    "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming and Path\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION`{: .filepath} and put it in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory. Please note that the `EXTENSION`{: .filepath} must be one of `md`{: .filepath} and `markdown`{: .filepath}. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin [`Jekyll-Compose`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Front Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, you need to fill the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) as below at the top of the post:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: TITLE\n",
    "date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT\n",
    "categories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]\n",
    "tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The posts' _layout_ has been set to `post` by default, so there is no need to add the variable _layout_ in the Front Matter block.\n",
    "{: .prompt-tip }\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timezone of Date\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories and Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "The `categories` of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "categories: [Animal, Insect]\n",
    "tags: [bee]\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Author Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the _Front Matter_ , they will be obtained from variables `social.name` and the first entry of `social.links` of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml` (If your website doesn't have this file, don't hesitate to create one).\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "<author_id>:\n",
    "  name: <full name>\n",
    "  twitter: <twitter_of_author>\n",
    "  url: <homepage_of_author>\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: file=\"_data/authors.yml\" }\n",
    "\n",
    "And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "author: <author_id>                     # for single entry\n",
    "# or\n",
    "authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The benefit of reading the author information from the file `_data/authors.yml`{: .filepath } is that the page will have the meta tag `twitter:creator`, which enriches the [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution) and is good for SEO.\n",
    "{: .prompt-info }\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post Description\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the first words of the post are used to display on the home page for a list of posts, in the _Further Reading_ section, and in the XML of the RSS feed. If you don't want to display the auto-generated description for the post, you can customize it using the `description` field in the _Front Matter_ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "description: Short summary of the post.\n",

    "## Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the **T**able **o**f **C**ontents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to `_config.yml`{: .filepath} and set the value of variable `toc` to `false`. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post's [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):\n",

    "## Comments\n",

    "The global setting for comments is defined by the `comments.provider` option in the `_config.yml`{: .filepath} file. Once a comment system is selected for this variable, comments will be enabled for all posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:\n",

    "## Media\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to images, audio and video as media resources in _Chirpy_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL Prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "From time to time we have to define duplicate URL prefixes for multiple resources in a post, which is a boring task that you can avoid by setting two parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are using a CDN to host media files, you can specify the `cdn` in `_config.yml`{: .filepath }. The URLs of media resources for site avatar and posts are then prefixed with the CDN domain name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  cdn: https://cdn.com\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  {: file='_config.yml' .nolineno }\n",
    "\n",
    "- To specify the resource path prefix for the current post/page range, set `media_subpath` in the _front matter_ of the post:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  media_subpath: /path/to/media/\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  {: .nolineno }\n",
    "\n",
    "The option `site.cdn` and `page.media_subpath` can be used individually or in combination to flexibly compose the final resource URL: `[site.cdn/][page.media_subpath/]file.ext`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caption\n",
    "\n",
    "Add italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "![img-description](/path/to/image)\n",
    "_Image Caption_\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: .nolineno}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Size\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }\n",

    "{: .prompt-info }\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from _Chirpy v5.0.0_, `height` and `width` support abbreviations (`height` → `h`, `width` → `w`). The following example has the same effect as the above:\n",

    "#### Position\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes `normal`, `left`, and `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Dark/Light mode\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (`dark` or `light`):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of `1200 x 630`. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet `1.91 : 1`, the image will be scaled and cropped.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the [`media_subpath`](#url-prefix) can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute `path` only needs the image file name.\n",
